# Geocaching for Ubuntu Touch

This is an unofficial fork of the original version from Evil Bunny. Because the app was broken and did not work anymore and the corresponing pull requests adressing these features were open for nearly a year it seemed like the app was abandoned long ago. Because the app itself seemed to be very well made and I couln't find a different geocaching App for Ubuntu Touch, I decided to fork the App, fix it and maybe add more functionality in the future. All credit goes to evilbunny2008, who created the app and vpzomtrrfrt, who made the two pull requests at the original code

An app for using geocaching.com(unofficial) on Ubuntu Touch, designed to be similar to [c:geo for Android](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo).

This is a community maintained project that I do in my free time. While all efforts are taken to test everything works, in some cases things get overlooked. If you spot a problem please try to fix it and contribute where you can. If you aren't able to fix the issue, please file a bug under issues so we can track the progress and resolution of the problem.

## Changelog

- V. 0.0.9: Added dark theme support!
This was the last(at least to my knowledge) critical bug that needed to be fixed before we submit the app to the open store again. The soluton is a bit hacky, but I will make it more elegant during the next update.

- V. 0.0.8: Added found Marker! 
Since I was extremely annoyed for not seeing witch caches were already found, I added a new marker, so every cache you found should be marked with a smiley! One small note: Because I made a change to the database, you have to delete all app data through the tweaktool.
